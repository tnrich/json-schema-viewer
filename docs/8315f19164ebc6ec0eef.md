# Introduction

Welcome to the Teselagen JSON Schema Viewer!

This site is used to host and view JSON Schemas for Teselagen's software. These schemas are used to validate the JSON objects that are sent to and from our software. 

Select a schema from the Schema Dropdown to view it. 

## Usage
You can edit the right side code view to see if there are any errors in your JSON. You can also drill down into the schema to see what is allowed at each level.
