# json-schema-viewer

Welcome to Teselagen's JSON Schema Viewer! (All credit for the original functionality goes to https://github.com/tnrich/json-schema-viewer)

This site is used to host and view JSON Schemas for Teselagen's software.

Try it out today at: https://json-schema.app

## Adding a schema

Just add a new schema to the `schemas` folder and add a link to it in `<SchemaApp>` by adding a new button:

```jsx
<NavigationButtonItem
  onClick={props.closePopup}
  exampleUrl="./schemas/design.json"
>
  Design
</NavigationButtonItem>
```

JSON Schema is awesome. It lets you define and validate the schema for your JSON object and is used to define many many JSON structures.
For example schemas, please see: https://www.schemastore.org/json/
